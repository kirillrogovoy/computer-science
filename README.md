## Learning Computer Science with Golang

This repository contains the results of my practical sessions on learning both CS and Golang.
It can be used as an example for everyone trying to implement the same things him/herself.

The code is fully tested and more or less matches how I approach programming. Though, I've made it only for fun and self-development.

Heavily inspired by https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university
